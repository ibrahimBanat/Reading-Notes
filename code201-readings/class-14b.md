And i qoute:

> 1.  The time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more’’ over the last two decades and that, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues.

> 2. In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.

Within companies and conglomerates, as well as in government agencies and schools, teams are now the fundamental unit of organization. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together.

what i like about this paragraphs that at some point if you desire to be sucessful you must to communicate with you surrounding and the people around you.

don't limit your self for what your own brain sees, but also see what others doing and you can push your imagination. as metallica said :

if you were in a place and you actually feel good about who you are working with, you will reach your maximum and do your best and give the best work and leave rejection behined.

> 4. Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized.

that's been said, thank you for your time reading this notes.
