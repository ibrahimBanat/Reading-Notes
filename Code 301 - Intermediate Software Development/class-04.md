# Responsive Web Design(RWD) & Regular Expressions(Regex)

Grid Layout

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

Display Property

An HTML element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid or inline-grid.

Many websites are a variation of this type of layout, with content, sidebars, a header and a footer. In a responsive design, you may want to display the layout as a single column, adding a sidebar at a certain breakpoint and then bring in a three-column layout for wider screens.

# Regular Expressions

egular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the `exec()` and `test()` methods of RegExp, and with the `match()`, matchAll(), `replace()`, `replaceAll()`, `search()`, and `split()` methods of String. This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions.
