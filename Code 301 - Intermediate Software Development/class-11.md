# What is EJS?

EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

## how to use EJS ?

- install and require EJS

```
npm i ejs
```

- create a view folder with ejs files

- require ejs with view folder in your server file:

```
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
```

## conclucsion

EJS lets us spin up quick applications when we donâ€™t need anything too complex. By using partials and having the ability to easily pass variables to our views, we can build some great applications quickly.
