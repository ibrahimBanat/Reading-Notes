# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

> Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. At Paradigm, we spend a lot of time brainstorming with CEOs and other company leaders about what is or should be driving their diversity and inclusion efforts.

## Diverse teams are smarter and more creative

Joelle Emerson is CEO and co-founder of Paradigm Study after study in fields like organizational science, psychology and education indicate that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation. According to Scott E. Page, professor of complex systems, political science and economics at the University of Michigan: "Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."

At Intel, CEO Brian Krzanich has said: "A fully diverse and inclusive workplace is fundamental to our ability to innovate and deliver business results." A number of leaders we’ve spoken to are motivated by this research in their efforts to build the strongest, most innovative teams.

## Diverse companies perform better

Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.
