# Call stack

A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
- When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
- If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.

## Example

```
function greeting() {
   // [1] Some code here
   sayHi();
   // [2] Some code here
}
function sayHi() {
   return "Hi!";
}

// Invoke the `greeting` function
greeting();

// [3] Some code here
```

The code above would be executed like this:

1. Ignore all functions, until it reaches the `greeting()` function invocation.
2. Add the `greeting()` function to the call stack list.

> Call stack list:
> -greeting

3. Execute all lines of code inside the `greeting()` function.

4. Get to the `sayHi()` function invocation.

5. Add the `sayHi()` function to the call stack list.
   > Call stack list:
   > -sayHi
   > -greeting

# Conclusion

then, we start with an empty Call Stack. Whenever we invoke a function, it is automatically added to the Call Stack. Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack. Ultimately, the Stack is empty again.
