# Flexbox and Templating

Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source.

The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

## FlexBox

CSS Flexbox Layout Module

The flex item properties are:

- order
- flex-grow
- flex-shrink
- flex-basis
- flex
- align-self

### align content

- normal (default): items are packed in their default position as if no value was set.

- flex-start / start: items packed to the start of the container. The (more supported) flex-start honors the flex-direction while start honors the writing-mode direction.

- flex-end / end: items packed to the end of the container. The (more support) flex-end honors the flex-direction while end honors the writing-mode direction.

- center: items centered in the container space-between: items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end

- space-around: items evenly distributed with equal space around each line
- space-evenly: items are evenly distributed with equal space around them
  stretch: lines stretch to take up the remaining space
