# Mark Down Documentation


Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

## What is Markdown
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a way to style text on the web. You control what you want to display of the document; formating text, adding images and creating lists.

You can use Markdown in many places such as [GitHub](https://github.com).

## Syntax Guide 
we will show a highlight of Markdown syntax that you can use in GithHub or in your text files.

### Headers
<br>


    # This is an <h1> tag
    ## This is an <h2> tag
    ###### This is an <h6> tag

### Emphasis
<br>

    *This text will be italic*
    _This will also be italic_

    **This text will be bold**
    __This will also be bold__

    _You **can** combine them_

### Lists 
    
- Unordered

    ```
    * Item 1
    * Item 2
        * Item 2a
        * Item 2b
    ```
- Ordered 

    ```
    * Item 1
    * Item 2
        * Item 2a
        * Item 2b 

### Images

    Format: ![Alt Text](url)

### Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens ` - ` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe ` | `:

```
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
```
and the result is hsown as: 

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column.
