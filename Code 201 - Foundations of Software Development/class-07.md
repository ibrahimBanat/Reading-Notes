# what is Domain Modeling ?
it is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem, it is As a communication tool witch verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders

## the constructor function :
it used to define the same properties between many objects and esintaly work on:
1. The `new` keyword instantiates (ex: creates) an object
2. The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable
3. The object is stored in a variable for later use

and the whol procises called ***object-oriented programming***


## prototype :
witch is object's stunt double, bulted in the object by defulty

> A shared code means a running program consumes less memory which is important for devices like 'smart phones and tablets'

# HTML:
# Tables :
witch A table represents information in a grid format
and Consists:
1. **`<table>`** :witch is element used to create a table, and contain:
2. **`<tr>`** :the start of each row
3. **`<td>`** :witch stands for table data
4. **`<th>`** :witch is to represent the heading for either a column or a row
Example of table:


you can also **Span: Rows OR ColumnS** by useing `rowspan` & `colspan` attrbiuts

# Long Tables :
use **`<thead>`** :as the heading of the long table
and use **`<tbody>`** :the body should sit inside the <tbody> element
and **`<tfoot>`** :as footer for the long table
and the result will be:

# JS:
## creating an object (the constractor way):
with `new` key word witch create a blanck object and you add properties and methods to..
`var hotel = new opject();`
you can update it normaly useing 'the dot/bracket notation'

## CREATING MANY OBJECTS:
First, create the template with the object's properties and methods



now use the `new` keyword followd by a call to the function to creats a new object *the properties of each object are given as arguments to the function



## creating objects ways:





## This (the keyword):
witch is commonly used inside functions and objects, It always refers to one object

> note that each key in the object must be unique when you want access items via property..

# Arrays :
witch actuly a special type of objects witch also can carry: {an other arrys, other objects, arrys had obje...

# The BUILT-IN OBJECTS :
witch represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window, and act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages, and they like:
1. BROWSER OBJECT MODEL



2. DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL



3. GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS



evrey one of them offer a different range of tools that help you to write the scripts..

## Summary 

- The `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web
page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the `<tr>` element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the `<td>` element (or `<th>` if it is a
header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>`,
`<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.

- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
