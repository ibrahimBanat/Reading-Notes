## lists

* *There are three different types:*
- *Oredered lists: are lists where each item in the list is numbered,The ordered list is created with the < ol > element.*

- *Unordered lists: are lists that begin with a bullet point The unordered list is created with the < ul > element.*

- *Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms,The definition list is created with the < d l> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.*

* ***Lists can be nested inside one another.***

## Boxes

* *The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems. Traditionally, pixels have been the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size.*

* ***Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:***

- Border
- Margin
- Padding

* Change inline/block
 display
*The display property allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa, and can also be used to hide an element from the page.*

## Arrays

*An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.*

* *You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array).*

* *Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).*

### Loop

*KEY LOOP CONCEPTS*

*Here are three points to consider when you are working with loops. Each is illustrated in examples on the following three pages.*


* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. 
 
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.

* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
