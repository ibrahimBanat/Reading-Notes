<br>
**Step 2**: Create a Local clone of your Fork.

- Right now, you have a fork of the Spoon-Knife repository, but you don't have the files in that repository on your computer. Let's create a clone of your fork locally on your computer.

    1. On GitHub, navigate to your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository.

    2. Above the list of files, click  Code.

    3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS",

    ![](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/https-url-clone.png)![](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/https-url-clone-cli.png)

    4. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of `YOUR-USERNAME`:

        - `$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/[repo-name]`
    
    5. press **ENTER**. Your local clone will be created.
