# Choosing a Text Editor 
Writing a good deal of code requires a good text editor to help doing that.

## What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

## Features of Text Editor
1. code completion
2. syntax
highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes
4. Extensions

TextWrangler is for Mac computers only, and you used to be able to
download it from the Mac App Store. In doing my research for this
blog post, I’ve come to find out that TextWrangler has been retired. I
know, I’m a little late to the party with this news, but TextWrangler
was retired in 2017. This was one of the go-to text editors for Mac
Computers.
But all hope is not lost, the folks that make TextWrangler, Bare Bones
Software has incorporated TextWrangler into its more robust, big
brother, BB Edit—another feature packed text editor

BB Edit is software that you purchase. But BB Edit comes with a 30-
day free trial. After the 30 days is over, if you still want the free
version, simply continue using BB Edit, and you’ll get the same
features as you would have gotten in TextWrangler

- Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft.
It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux
computers. VS Code has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS
already built-in with no additional work from you at all. VS Code has
everything: syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code
completion. It seems like VS Code has a very healthy following in the
web developing community.

- Atom

)

Atom is a free text editor that’s available for download for Windows
computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. Atom is brought to
you by the folks at GitHub . GitHub is a great service online where
you can host and review code, or you can post and get help with the
development of your own projects. Atom also ticks all the right boxes.
It has syntax highlighting, themes, extensions, the works! Atom is
definitely a software to check out and test drive for yourself.

## The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs

- IDEs:

    An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
    different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
    manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. 

    You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If
    you’ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed
    that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all
    in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one
    software package.

 - Text Editor

    A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
    It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text
    wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It
    wrangles your text together into something meaningful.

## Opening a Terminal 
It is easy to open a terminal but you need first follow the steps which related to your OS.

- Mac OS:
    - if you're a mac user you're gonna find the **terminal** under **Application** -> **Utilites**, An easy way to opent the command line is to use the combanation of `command+space` which will bring you spotligt, and start typing terminal.
<br> 

- Linux:
    - you will probably find it in **Application** -> **System** or **Application** -> **Utilites**.

- Windows: 
    - if you're a windows user you should remotly log into another machine then you need to use the SSH client.

## Basic Commands
1. pwd command
    - Use the Pwd command to find out the current working directory that you're in.

1. cd command
    - to navigate through the linux files and directories, lets say that you're in the `/home/username/Documents` and you want to go to Photos you can simply type:<br><br>
    `cd Photos `<br><br>

1. ls command 
    - the ls command is used to view the contents of a directory, by default it will show the content of the working directory
 
## Basic Navigations 

<br>

### where are us now ?
The first command we are going to learn is `pwd` which stands for Print Working Directory. (You'll find that a lot of commands in linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or words describing them. This makes it easier to remember them.) The command does just that. It tells you what your current or present working directory is. Give it a try now.

### What's in Our Current Location?

It's one thing to know where we are. Next we'll want to know what is there. The command for this task is ls. It's short for list. Let's give it a go.

![](img/ls.PNG)

Whereas pwd is just run by itself with no arguments, ls is a little more powerful. We have run it here with no arguments in which case it will just do a plain listing of our current location. We can do more with ls however. Below is an outline of its usage:
