## How to Solve Programming Problems

you had better to learn how to solve programming problems, and in this reading i am going to give a good tools to enable you you to get good at solving programming problems.

### common mistakes

programmers do common mistakes when they are given a question in interview: <br>

1. the most common mistake is programmers try to start writing code as soon as possible.
2. trying to over solve the problem on the first iteration.

- make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely beafore attempting to solve it.

- keep it simple don't try to over solve the problem, don't get fancy

### steps for solving alogrithm type programming problem

1. read the problem twice
2. solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. optimize the manual steps.
4. write the manual steps as pseudo codes or comments.
5. replce the comment or the pseduo code with a real code.
6. optimize the real code.

## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour

How you value your time is how you value your life.

> “Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas Göke

you have a few on this earth. people say yes to low-quality activites that don't help them to reach their true goals.

**But what if you place high value on your time ?**

### “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness

> “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss

it takes a dicipline to not become “busy.”

lives are wasted — by doing thankless work for ungrateful takers that didn’t deserve your time in the first place. it's not bad to be busy but:

**“The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”**

who is in charge of your time? you ? or everyone else?

### Stress are the enemy

> “People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.” -William Irvine

for most people, this “busyness” is nothing more than distraction and procrastination from what really matters. They just like feeling busy.

Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.

**“Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”**

### You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them

> “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” -Warren Buffet

You probably need to say “no” more.

Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities. The world’s most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things.

Really successful people say no to most things, because most things won’t get them to where they truly want to be.

**“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”**

## How to think like a programmer?

> “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs

### Why is this important?

We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.

Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems:

1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

Look, sometimes you luck out. But that is the worst way to solve problems! And it’s a huge, huge waste of time.

### Have a framework

what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

1. Understand

Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them.

How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

2. Plan

Don’t dive right into solving without a plan!
Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

3. Divide

break the problem into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer.

4. Stuck ?

First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair.

here are three things to try when facing a whammy: - Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong.

    - Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be  abstracted to a more general approach?

    - Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).

### Practice

Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with `<insert concept here>`.”

## 5 Whys

Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

Stubborn or recurrent problems are often symptoms of deeper issues. "Quick fixes" may seem convenient, but they often solve only the surface issues and waste resources that could otherwise be used to tackle the real cause.

### When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis

You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

### How to Use the 5 Whys

1. Assemble a Team

Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

2. Define the Problem

If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example, "Team A isn't meeting its response time targets" or "Software release B resulted in too many rollback failures."

3. Ask the First "Why?"

Ask your team why the problem is occurring. (For example, "Why isn't Team A meeting its response time targets?")

Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times

For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.

5. Know When to Stop

You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident. (As we said earlier, if you're not sure that you've uncovered the real root cause, consider using a more in-depth problem-solving technique like Cause and Effect Analysis , Root Cause Analysis , or FMEA .)
