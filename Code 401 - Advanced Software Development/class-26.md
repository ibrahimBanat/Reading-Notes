# Component Based UI

Component based UI systems like React, Angular, Vue and the like all operate on a variation of "Atomic Design", using "Components" as the means of delivery.

"Thinking in React" means re-evaluating how you look at a web application: Breaking down it's functional parts, data dependencies, behaviors, and styles into independent, deliverable, re-usable components.

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

   - Angular
   - Vue
   - Ember
   - Svelte
   - Webix

2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?

   - it's a difficult topic to cover because of the inconsistencies, it's not a single person or entity defining these two words, it's a community. so the usages of these words in the community can be alot more losse.

   - Library: just a bunch of code that someone else wrote that we can us in our applications. example (jQuery).
   - Frameworks: conceptual and technological support structure defined, generally, with specific software artifacts or modules, which can serve as a basis for the organization and development of software.

   - The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control". When you call a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you. Both of them define an API for programmers to use.
