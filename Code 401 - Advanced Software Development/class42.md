# Class 42 Reading: Ethics in Tech

## Article #1 Ethics in the workplace - Microsoft Employees Protest Work with Ice, as Tech Industry Mobilizes Over Immigration

this article, it made me think that more than anything, tech should be used to enrich lives and make do good in the world. We all need more good in the world. This also has made me really question thinking of Microsoft as a top company to work for. I really loved their mission statement but it makes me think if they are really following it??  
I would be though, proud of being on a team and working with the employees that have decided to take a stand when calling out these wrongs. That's something that I would be looking for of my fellow employees when joining a team.

## Article #2 Ethics in Technology - Big Data is our Generation's Civil Rights Issue, and we don't know it

I did really like the examples of good that big data does, like help detect disease or improve how students learn... So this is where I feel torn. Down with big data! Or...it's clearly a good when not abused. The Government does need to step in a little bit more though to regulate and make sure that civil liberities aren't being infringed upon.. but where we're at with the Government and trust is a little shakey so it would be interesting to see if that actually happens.
