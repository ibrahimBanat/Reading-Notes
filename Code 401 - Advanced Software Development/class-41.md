1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

Ducks is a way to bundle reducers, action types, and actions into the same file. Rather than splitting up related code, it can be packaged into redux modules. Redux Toolkit’s goal is to help simplify common Redux use cases. It is not intended to be a complete solution for everything you might want to do with Redux, but it should make a lot of Redux-related code you need to write a lot simpler. Redux Toolkit exports several individual functions that you can use in your application, and adds in dependencies on some other packages that are commonly used with Redux.

3. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code.

## React Native :

What is React Native ?

React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, Inc. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use React's framework along with native platform capabilities.

Why is REACT Native ?

- With React Native Framework, you can render UI for both iOS and Android platforms.

- It is an open source framework, which could be compatible with other platforms like Windows or tvOS in the near future.

- Since React Native components have the counterpart rights, you can reuse these components for building both Android and iOS apps.

- You can either incorporate REACT Native components into the code of existing app or reuse the Cordova-based code with the help of the plugin as well. However, your existing app must be built with Cordova and Ionic code.

- React Native Development is comparatively simple, quick and efficient.

- REACT Native is a great pick for those developers who have expertise in JavaScript as there is no need to learn Android specific Java or iOS’s Swift.
  React Native is a UI focused, which makes the apps load quickly and gives a smoother feel.

- Another reason why the REACT Native framework has gained popularity in recent years is that the framework helps cater both the platforms at one go and ends the holy war of selecting either iOS or Android development for mobile developers. Hence, giant companies like Facebook, Instagram, Skype, Airbnb, Tesla, Walmart, Baidu Mobile, Bloomberg, UberEATS Vogue and many more have shifted their eyeballs towards it.
