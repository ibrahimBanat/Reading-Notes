# OAuth

OAuth:

which stands for “Open Authorization, is a technological standard that allows you to share information between services without exposing your password. It’s a widely-adopted standard that’s used by developers of websites and apps, and you probably use services every day that utilize OAuth.

## How OAuth works?

OAuth allows third-party services to exchange your information without you having to give away your password. Because the more you give away your password, the more you give away your passwords, the more likely it is that your passwords will get compromised.

OAuth uses a system of tokens. Called “access tokens”. An access token gives one third-party source temporary access to a limited amount of your personal information on another third-party source.
