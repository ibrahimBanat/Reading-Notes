## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What’s the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?

   - `PUT` is for checking if resource is exist then update, else create new resources.

   **example**: if the client sends data with identifier, then we will chck whether that identifier exists. if it is exist, update the resource with the data and generate new identifier.

   - `PATCH` is always for update a resource.
     **example**: the client sends data with identifier, then we will checnk whether the identifier exist. if the identifier exists, we will update the resource with the data, else we will throw an exception.

2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server.

| Implementation complexity |    both required documentation content on implemented method as customize comment data    | In addition they allow to write documentation data in separate resource file as .js and .json. |
|        Maintenance        |    have to modify documentation for each affected method/endpoints if service changed     |          we can limit changes. But by implementing apidocjs we can isolate the layer.          |
|      Other benefits       |                                                                                           |            swagger use plain .json that could be parsed through programing language            |
|          Future           | Due to popularity of swagger, apidocjs provide information about apidoc-swagger converter |                          so we can switch apidoc to swagger anytime.                           |

| SOAP is a protocol. SOAP was designed with a specification. It includes a WSDL file which has the required information on what the web service does in addition to the location of the web service.                                 | REST is an Architectural style in which a web service can only be treated as a RESTful service if it follows the constraints of being Client Server Stateless Cacheable Layered System Uniform Interface                                                                                                                            |
| SOAP cannot make use of REST since SOAP is a protocol and REST is an architectural pattern.                                                                                                                                         | REST can make use of SOAP as the underlying protocol for web services, because in the end it is just an architectural pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| SOAP uses service interfaces to expose its functionality to client applications. In SOAP, the WSDL file provides the client with the necessary information which can be used to understand what services the web service can offer. | REST use Uniform Service locators to access to the components on the hardware device. For example, if there is an object which represents the data of an employee hosted on a URL as http://demo.guru99 , the below are some of URI that can exist to access them http://demo.guru99.com/Employee http://demo.guru99.com/Employee/1 |

| hardware or software, or both of them working together. 1. On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files. (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files) A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web. 2. On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLs (web addresses) and HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device. | Express.js is a free and open-source web application framework for Node.js. It is used for designing and building web applications quickly and easily. Web applications are web apps that you can run on a web browser. Since Express.js only requires javascript, it becomes easier for programmers and developers to build web applications and API without any effort. | Network routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. The principles of routing can apply to any type of network, from telephone networks to public transportation. In packet-switching networks, such as the Internet, routing selects the paths for Internet Protocol (IP) packets to travel from their origin to their destination. | The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers. |
