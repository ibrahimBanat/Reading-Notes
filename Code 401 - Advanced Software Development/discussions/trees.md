| Path       | Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.                                                                                                       |
| Root       | The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.                                          |
| Parent     | Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent..                                                                                           |
| Child      | The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.                                                                                  |
| Leaf       | The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.                                                                                                  |
| Subtree    | Subtree represents the descendants of a node.                                                                                                                         |
| Visiting   | Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.                                                                                          |
| Traversing | Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.                                                                                                           |
| Levels     | Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on. |
| keys       | Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node                                                                    |
